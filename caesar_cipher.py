				Geographic information may be naturally represented
				in two dimensions, medical imaging may provide three-dimensional scans
				of a patient, and a companyâ€™s valuation is often based upon a high number of independent
				financial measures that can be modeled as multidimensional data. A
				two-dimensional array is sometimes also called a matrix. We may use two indices,
				say i and j, to refer to the cells in the matrix. The first index usually refers to a
				row number and the second to a column number, and these are traditionally zeroindexed
				in computer science. Figure 5.22 illustrates a two-dimensional data set
				with integer values. This data might, for example, represent the number of stores
